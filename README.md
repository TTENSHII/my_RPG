### Our goal
We wanted to make a funny game that Epitech new comers, 'Tek1' as we call them, could play to learn about the life at our school.

We combined ideas and finally came up with an exact replica of Epitech Toulouse 6th floor, with the accurate rooms and personnal.

## How to play ?

Simply execute the commands: 
```bash
sudo "..." install libcsfml-dev

git clone git@github.com:TTENSHII/my_RPG.git

cd my_rpg/

make

./my_rpg
```
The game will start and you can play !

#### In the game:

Check the ' Help ' section to learn how to interact with the game.

You can start a new game or load an already existing one.

By interacting with some NPCs in the game, you can save your game.
